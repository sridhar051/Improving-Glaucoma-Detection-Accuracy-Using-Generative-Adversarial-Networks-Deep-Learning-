# Improving-Glaucoma-Detection-Accuracy-Using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Deep-Learning-

"Accuracy in glaucoma detection sees a remarkable boost when integrating external datasets, thanks to the innovative use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By employing Deep Learning techniques, specifically the RESNET50 model, the project automates the detection process using fundus images. Glaucoma, a condition causing optic nerve damage often linked to elevated eye pressure, can lead to blindness. Addressing the challenge of diverse fundus image sources, the project introduces a pioneering framework named DAGD, effectively bridging the gap between different datasets. Despite challenges such as limited data and hardware constraints, integrating external datasets results in a significant increase in accuracy, reaching an impressive 88%. This groundbreaking approach highlights the potential of GANs in leveraging external data sources to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of glaucoma diagnosis."
