**Glaucoma Detection with Enhanced Accuracy Using External Datasets**

This project leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to significantly improve accuracy in glaucoma detection. Through the integration of external datasets and innovative Deep Learning techniques, specifically the RESNET50 model, the system automates glaucoma detection using fundus images. Glaucoma, a condition leading to optic nerve damage often due to elevated eye pressure, can result in blindness. Our solution addresses the challenge of diverse fundus image sources by introducing DAGD, a cutting-edge framework that effectively bridges the gap between different datasets. Despite limited data and hardware constraints, integrating external datasets results in a substantial increase in accuracy, reaching an impressive 88%. This project showcases the potential of GANs and external data integration in advancing glaucoma diagnosis efficiency and precision.
